7 Key Principle:
1. Testing shows presence of Defects : Find Defects
2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible! : It's not Possible to Test Everything
3. Early Testing : Start Testing from first stage
4. Defect Clustering : If One Project Having a some errors that error should not effect another working project
5. The Pesticide Paradox : Regulary Review and Revised
6. Testing is Context Dependent : You can not Test Every Project in same way
7. Absence of Errors Fallacy : Error should not occured
