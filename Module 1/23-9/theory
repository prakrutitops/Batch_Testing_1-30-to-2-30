Entry :Coding Complete

QA ->Quality Assurance
Identify types of tests to be performed
Gather details about testing priorities and focus.
Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).

Identify test environment details where testing is supposed to be carried out.

Requirement Planning Report:

RTM
Automation feasibility report. (if applicable)


Tester -Testing
Developer -Debugging

Self Testing & Independent Testing:
This degree of independence avoids author bias and is often Testing
more effective at finding defects and failures

Levels of Testing:
1)Unit Testing (Componenet Testing)-
-> The testing of individual software components.
-> Single Unit
-> Unit Testing, Module Testing or Program Testing
-> Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs and mock or fake objects
-> Unit testing is performed by using the White Box Testing method.

1)Black Box ->data hidden
2)White Box ->data visible



2)Integration Testing-
-> Unit Testing
-> Combine ->integrate->combine
-> Integration Testing is a level of the software testing process 
   where individual units are combined and tested as a group.
-> Component Integration Testing
-> System Integration Testing

========================System Integration Testing===============================

-> Big Bang Integration Testing

1)Top Down
2)Bottom Up

1->Assume -> Driver


2->Assume -> Stub




===================================================================================

3)System Testing-
=> Functional System Testing
=> A requirement that specifies a function that a system or system component must perform
4)Acceptance Testing-
